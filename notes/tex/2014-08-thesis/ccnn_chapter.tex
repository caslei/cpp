\chapter{Detection with the Cascade CNN}\label{sec:ccnn_chapter}

\PM{Motivation}
With the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual recognition, the state-of-the-art in detection has shifted.
Whereas in \autoref{sec:det_problem}, a detector model was trained per class, and evaluated densely on the image, currently best-performing methods train one detector for all classes, and evaluate on a subset of possible image regions \parencite{Girshick-CVPR-2014}.
The method is still computationally expensive, taking about 10 seconds per image even with multi-threaded matrix and convolution operations.
The strategy to speed detection up, however, has to change.
