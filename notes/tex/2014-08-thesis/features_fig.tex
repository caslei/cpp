Summary of the variety of features for object detection and classification.
In reading order for classification: SIFT \parencite{Lowe2004}, HOG \parencite{Dalal2005}, CNN \parencite{Krizhevsky-NIPS-2012}, Self-Similarity \parencite{Shechtman2007}, Haar basis functions \parencite{Viola-IJCV-2004}, basis functions learned with sparse coding \parencite{Olshausen1996}.
In reading order for detection: person, bicycle, and car templates for the Deformable Part Model \parencite{Felzenszwalb2010a}.
(The features depicted were not computed on the images depicted.)
