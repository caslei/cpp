\caption[Results of the classification approach on the ILSVRC-65 dataset.]{
Results on the ILSVRC-65 dataset (best viewed in color).
Figure (a) shows our dynamic approaches outperforming static baselines for all practical cost budgets.
When our method is combined with Hedging Your Bets \parencite{Deng-CVPR-2012}, a constant prediction accuracy can be achieved at all points in the Anytime policy, with \emph{specificity} of predictions increasing with the cost of predictions.
Figures (b) and (c) show this for the \emph{dynamic, non-myopic} policy learned for budget = 26.
This is analogous to human visual performance, which shows increased specificity at longer stimulus times.
