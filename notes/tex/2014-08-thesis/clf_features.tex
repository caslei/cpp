\subsection{Features of the state}\label{sec:clf_features}

The featurization function $\phi(s)$ extracts the following features from the state:

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-.5\baselineskip}
\item Bit vector $\textbf{m}$ of length $F$: initially all bits are $1$ and are set to $0$ when the corresponding feature is computed.
\item For each $h_f$, a vector of size $d_f$ representing the values; $0$ until observed.
\item Cost feature $c \in [0, 1]$, for fraction of the budget spent.
\item Bias feature $1$.
\end{itemize}

\PM{Static vs Dynamic}
These features define the \textbf{dynamic} state, presenting enough information to have a \emph{closed-loop} (dynamic) policy that may select different features for different test instances.
The \textbf{static} state has all of the above features except for the observed feature values.
This enables only an \emph{open-loop} (static) policy, which is exactly the same for all instances.
Policy learned with the static state is used as a baseline in experiments.
