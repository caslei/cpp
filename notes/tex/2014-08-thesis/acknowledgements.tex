I am fortunate to have worked with consistently amazing people during my PhD.
My advisor Trevor Darrell has always provided wise and encouraging guidance, and supported every direction that excited me.
My close collaborator and mentor Mario Fritz is responsible for too many of ``my'' ideas to count.
Regular meetings with Pieter Abbeel helped develop the reinforcement learning formulation of vision problems presented in this thesis.
Ken Goldberg, Jitendra Malik, and Bruno Olshausen provided crucial inter-disciplinary North Stars to keep in view.
Aaron Hertzmann, Holger Winnemoeller, and Aseem Agarwala introduced me to the novel recognition problem of image style, and Alyosha Efros has been tirelessly encouraging of this line of work.

The bulk of graduate school life and learning is centered on one's peers, and at Berkeley I was lucky to be among the truly best.
Yangqing Jia, Jon Barron, Adam Roberts, Trevor Owens, Hyun Oh Song, Ning Zhang, Judy Hoffman, Allie Janoch, Jon Long, Jeff Donahue, Evan Shelhamer, Georgia Gkioxari, Saurabh Gupta, Bharath Hariharan, Subhransu Maji, Sanja Fidler, Carl Henrik Ek, Brian Kulis, Kate Saenko, Mario Christoudias, Oriol Vinyals, Ross Girshick, Sergio Guadarrama, and so many others.

Last but not least, I am deeply indebted to the love and support of my parents.
This thesis is dedicated to them.
