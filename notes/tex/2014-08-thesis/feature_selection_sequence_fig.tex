Summary of our dynamic feature selection approach to the classification problem.]{
We model the problem of state traversal as a Markov Decision Process.
For every state, we learn to select action of maximum expected value.
The state is updated with the result of the selected action.
We train a classifier on subsets of features, to give answer at any time.
