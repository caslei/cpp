Definition of the reward function.
To maximize the total area above the entropy vs. cost curve from $0$ to $\mathcal{B}$, we define the reward of an individual action as the area of the slice of the total area that it contributes.
From state $s$, action $a = h_f$ leads to state $s'$ with cost $c_f$.
The information gain is $I_{\mathcal{H}_s}(Y; h_f) = H(Y; \mathcal{H}_s) - H(Y; \mathcal{H}_s \cup {h_f})$.
